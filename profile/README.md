# Hey, this is Snabble! 
![Team Snabble](https://snabble.io/hubfs/snabble-team-2021@3x.webp)

In 2018, Sebastian Mancke founded **Snabble** as a spin-off company of the tarent AG. Our **Scan & Go app** is a multi-retailer app. As a platform, it combines all retailers in one app. In addition, we are working on many features such as couponing and product recommendations.

Our focus is to build a perfect **Self-Checkout platform** and gaining experience and the best possible product.


# This is how we do :rainbow:

We are the team behind our product. We are always open to ideas for further development. What is most important for us:

## :sloth: Flat hirachie

We want to stay agile and get our ideas down on paper quickly. Flat hierarchies are therefore essential.

## 🤬 Freedom of communication

Every perspective and opinion is important. Everyone should feel welcomed and comfortable in our team.

## :brain: Collaborative product development

Top down is not our style. Not only because we don't have it, but also because we don't want it. We would like everyone to provide a contribution to the product.

# This is what we do 👨‍💻👩‍💻 

Our business is a mix of **project work** and **product development**. If a key client wants a certain new feature, we develop it for them. Otherwise, we use our knowledge of the market to optimize our product.

# Become a part of the Team :football:

We are always looking for additional talent. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via LinkedIn or Mail.

Otherwise, you can find our current job overview here: https://snabble.io/en/jobs
